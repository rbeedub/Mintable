//   In our first live session, we will cover the first dimension of great management: Awareness. It means being conscious of your environment, the people in it, and yourself.</p>

// <p>Awareness is paying attention. Seeing what might be easy to overlook. Hearing, feeling, sensing, and understanding more carefully. And good news! You’ve already been practicing awareness as you reflected on and labelled your transition to management. This practice helped you understand where to focus and what to do next.</p>

// <p>The reason awareness is such a critical dimension of management is because you are inherently intended to have an impact on systems and people. You achieve goals by working through others. This means that your ability to understand a situation, your role, and the dynamics of other people in it is critical to success.</p>
// <img class="ui small right floated image" src="./images/aware2.svg"/>

// <p>For example, let’s say you are a sales manager trying to get your team to hit your monthly target. You would act differently based on your and your team’s tenure, what motivates each team member, the goal and its attainability. Some reps might respond well to challenges and competition. Others may perform with support and cheering on. You may need to call in additional resources to achieve the goal.</p>
// <br></br>

// <p>Even those of us who intentionally practice awareness can accidentally skip it or not spend enough time in this dimension. And that makes sense. You may have gotten thrown into a new role. You’re running around doing a million things. No one has told you what to do or how to do it. You’re in meetings all day, you have a big deadline, you’re still doing IC work, the list goes on.</p>
// <br></br>

// <p>Awareness becomes increasingly important and difficult in an environment where you are working across many communication channels; where it’s difficult to spend time thinking; and where your team may be remote and more disconnected.</p>

// <p>Committing to awareness is nearly half the battle. When we don’t commit to slowing down to observe and reflect, it catches up with us. </p>
// <br></br>
// <img class="ui small left floated image" src="/images/aware1.svg"></img>
// <p>Perhaps we don’t check in enough with our own motivations and get burnt out? We keep pushing our team towards a goal without the support they need and we see morale decline, performance dip, and attrition. We skip the steps of clarifying our role in a given quarter or on a project and we end up misaligned and frustrated with our manager. Even a simple, common occurrence - we don’t understand what’s important to other stakeholders in a meeting, land on the wrong outcome, and lose trust with a partner in the business.</p>
// <br></br>

// <p>Awareness will be embedded in everything we teach in The Mintable.</p>

// <p>There are many ways to practice awareness to be a better manager. We recommend starting with three key practices:</p>
// <br></br>

// <p> - Define stakeholders</p>
// <p> - Understand and align on expectations with your own manager</p>
// <p> - Cultivate self-awareness in your new role</p>
// <br></br>
// <p>These are the elements of awareness that we'll cover in our live session, and they are aligned to your level-up challenges afterward.</p>

// <p>Let's GROW!</p>
