    One of the toughest aspects of becoming a manager is not knowing exactly what the role entails 🤔

We’ve developed a manager framework so you can understand what great looks like. It’s something that you can put into practice on Day 1 and build on as you advance in your career.
    </p>
        <p>Each of the five dimensions below represents a cluster of thinking, attitudes, capabilities, and behaviors that we see successful managers practice. To begin, managers may be better at 1-2 of the dimensions. Great managers work at flexing across the dimensions.</p>
        <p>We see this framework as a foundation upon which managers can develop their own unique management style. You should incorporate other methodologies and create your own.</p>
